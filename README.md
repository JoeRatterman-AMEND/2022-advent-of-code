<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Repo
The repo contains my solutions to solve the 2022 Advent of Code Challenge. For those unfamiliar 'Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other' - From the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) websit. 

I first learned about the challenge in 2021 and quickly loved the challenge of it. I highly recommend the challenges for anyone looking to improve their problem solving & programming skills. It's a fun way to track your development as a programmer, a few days into the 2022 challenge, I can already see how much I've developed since 2021. Check out my solutions!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
